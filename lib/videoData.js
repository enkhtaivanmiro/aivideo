    prompt: 'Prompt: The scene erupts with the chaotic intensity of a desperate battle on the windswept Mongolian steppes in the 13th century, as a small band of Mongolian warriors, clad in fur-lined armor and wielding curved swords, fight fiercely against an overwhelming enemy force of armored invaders. The sky is a stormy gray, with dust and arrows filling the air, while the warriors shout battle cries in the ancient Mongolian tongue. A young warrior, his face smeared with dirt and blood, raises a tattered banner of the Mongol tribes, rallying his comrades in a final stand for their freedom.',

    prompt: 'Prompt: In the heart of Ulaanbaatar, under a gray, uncertain sky, thousands of Mongolians gather—students, elders, workers, and herders—united by outrage and hope.

The camera weaves through the crowd, capturing clenched fists, tearful chants, and the raw power of collective defiance. Across from them stands the seat of power—silent, guarded, watching. This is not just a protest. This is a people’s reckoning, a historic moment in the fight to bring down Oyun-Erdene and reclaim the future of Mongolia',
